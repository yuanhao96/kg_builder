# Stage 1 — Entity & Relationship Extraction Prompts

Stage 1 runs two sequential LLM passes on the input document.

## Pass 1 — Entity Extraction

Send this prompt (fill in `{DOCUMENT}` and `{RUBRIC}`):

```
You are an expert information-extraction assistant.

RUBRIC:
{RUBRIC}

DOCUMENT:
{DOCUMENT}

Task: Extract all entities from the DOCUMENT that match the types defined in the RUBRIC.
For each entity, record:
  - id: unique identifier (e1, e2, ...)
  - text: the exact surface form as it appears in the document
  - type: the entity type from the rubric
  - context: the sentence or clause where the entity appears

Output ONLY valid JSON. Do not include explanation or commentary.

Format:
{
  "entities": [
    { "id": "e1", "text": "...", "type": "...", "context": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### Filling in {RUBRIC}

- If `kg_rubric.md` exists in the working directory: insert its full contents.
- Otherwise: insert the full contents of `references/default-rubric.md`.
- If the user described a rubric inline: insert their description verbatim.

### Filling in {DOCUMENT}

Insert the full contents of the input document.
For documents longer than ~8,000 words, process in overlapping chunks of ~4,000 words (500-word overlap):
1. Run Pass 1 on each chunk to get per-chunk entity lists. Assign globally unique ids (chunk 1: e1–eN, chunk 2: eN+1–eM, etc.). Merge all entity lists.
2. Run Pass 2 on EACH CHUNK separately using only the entities extracted from that chunk. After all chunks, merge the triple lists. Duplicate triples (same source text + relation + target text) should be deduplicated, keeping the first occurrence.

## Pass 2 — Relationship Extraction

After Pass 1 completes, send this prompt (fill in `{ENTITIES}`, `{DOCUMENT}`, `{RUBRIC}`):

```
You are an expert information-extraction assistant.

RUBRIC:
{RUBRIC}

DOCUMENT:
{DOCUMENT}

ENTITIES ALREADY IDENTIFIED:
{ENTITIES}

Task: Extract all relationships between the entities listed above.
Only use entity ids from the ENTITIES list above. Do not create new entity ids.
For each relationship, record:
  - source_id: id of the source entity
  - relation: relationship label (uppercase, underscore-separated)
  - target_id: id of the target entity
  - evidence: copy the supporting sentence verbatim from the DOCUMENT — use the exact characters as they appear; do not paraphrase, condense, or rephrase

Output ONLY valid JSON. Do not include explanation or commentary.

Format:
{
  "triples": [
    { "source_id": "e1", "relation": "BORN_IN", "target_id": "e2", "evidence": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### Filling in {ENTITIES}

Insert the JSON output from Pass 1.

---

## Merging Pass 1 + Pass 2 Output

Combine into a single JSON object:

```json
{
  "entities": [ ...from Pass 1... ],
  "triples": [ ...from Pass 2... ]
}
```

Store this as the Stage 1 output to pass to Stage 2.
